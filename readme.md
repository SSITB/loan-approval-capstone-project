Machine Learning For Banking: Loan Approval Use Case
=====================================================

I modelled loan approval likelihood based on 30 million LendingClub.com loan applications and achieved 98 percent test set accuracy score by fitting a fully connected neural network model using an AWS EC2 instance. I also built an associated online Flask application called "My Lending Club" that uses five borrower features to tell whether the loan application would be approved by the LendingClub and provides a graphical explanation of the outcome.
